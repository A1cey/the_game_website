## Rules

### Round Flow
1. The player trusts the previous player -> They roll the dice.
2. The player does **not** trust the previous player -> They end the game round by revealing the dice.

### Rolling the Dice
* Players take turns rolling the dice.
* After rolling, the player can choose whether to reveal the rolled value or lie and pass on a different value.
* A second roll is allowed, and the player has to pass on a number without knowing the result.
* The player can also decide to pass on a higher number without rolling, if they believe the previous player rolled higher than declared.\
*Optional*: The Mäxle can be passed along up to the player just before the one who rolled it.
* The next number must always be higher than the previous one.

### Revealing
1. If the number declared by the previous player matches the rolled value -> The revealing player loses one life.
2. If the number declared by the previous player does **not** match the rolled value -> The previous player loses one life.
3. A new round starts with the player who lost a life.
